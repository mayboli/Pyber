# Pyber

Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

After analyzing 120 cities (urban, suburban, and rural) and 2375 rides for Pyber, a ride sharing company, I have concluded with some trends in the data provided. 

The most obvious trend I have discovered is that there is a lot more rides in urban areas (1625) compared to suburban (625) and rural (125). This may be due to the fact that there are more people living in urban areas compared to the rest, hence more rides. Or, this can be due to people living in urban areas have less access to a car due to parking and traffic. 

Another trend shown with the data is that there is an inverse linear relationship between the total amount of rides and the average fare. As the total amount of rides per city increase, the average fare decreases. This might occur because when people are willing to share a ride with someone else going the same way, the fare is split between all the riders. 

One more trend discovered with the data is that the more drivers there are, the lower the average fare. This is probably due to the huge supply of drivers competing for business, which in turn lowers the average fare. High supply of drivers and lower demand of rides means lower average fare.
